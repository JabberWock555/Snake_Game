Welcome to the Snake 2D Game!

Description

The Snake 2D Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it eats food. The objective of the game is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail. As the game progresses, the speed of the snake increases, making it more challenging to avoid collisions.

How to Play

Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to control the direction of the snake in Single Player.
Use the arrow keys for Player 1 and WASD keys for Player 2 to control the direction of the snake in Multi Player.
The snake will move continuously in the direction it is facing.
Eat the food to increase the length of the snake.
Eat PowerUps to get different powers.
Avoid eating skulls as they decrease score and snake length.
Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail.
The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own tail.
In Multi Player, if one player bites another player then the other player loses but in head on collision the player with lower score loses.
